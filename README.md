# Smart-Car-Project
This project simulates a smart car system that integrates light detection and an ultrasonic sensor to monitor the surrounding environment. It uses an LDR to detect light levels and automatically control the lights of the car. Also, an ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to objects, and a buzzer alerts the user when an object is too close.
